title: Fixing bwBASIC on FreeDOS
---

BwBASIC is very old fashioned, Open Source BASIC interpreter.  If you have Ubuntu to hand, you can install it straight from `apt`.

FreeDOS also has a package for it on the installer, but unfortunately it complains when you try to run it:

```none
C:\DEVEL\BWBASIC>bwbasic
This program must be run under Win32

C:\DEVEL\BWBASIC>
```

Well that's a problem.  It looks like at some stage, FreeDOS had an extension which let it run Win32 console programs, but that seems absent in my install/on the installer image.

It's quite possible that bwBASIC has been rebuilt in the online repository, but my EeePC FreeDOS machine is not connected to any kind of network.  Luckily, bwBASIC is Open Source, and FreeDOS include the sources with the package.  So let's rebuild it with the OpenWatcom C compiler which is bundled on the image.

First, we need to get our hands on the source.  To install a package with sources, you need to do `fdnpkg remove bwbasic` to uninstall the package and then `fdnpkg install-wsrc` instead of `fdnpkg install`.  It then places the sources in `C:\FDOS\SOURCES\<pkg>\SOURCES.ZIP`.

```none
C:\PACKAGES\DEVEL>fdnpkg install-wsrc bwbasic.zip
 source\bwbasic\sources.zip -> C:\FDOS\source\bwbasic\
 devel\bwbasic\example.bas -> C:\devel\bwbasic\
 devel\bwbasic\copying -> C:\devel\bwbasic\
 devel\bwbasic\bwbasic.exe -> C:\devel\bwbasic\
 devel\bwbasic\bwbasic.doc -> C:\devel\bwbasic\
 appinfo\bwbasic.lsm -> C:\FDOS\appinfo\
Package bwbasic installed: 6 files extracted, 0 errors.

C:\PACKAGES\DEVEL>
```

Well that's neat.  Copy `C:\FDOS\source\bwbasic\sources.zip` somewhere and issue `fdnpkg remove bwbasic` to uninstall the package.

You can then unpack the zip file with unzip as usual and take a peek inside.  You'll see that there's a bunch of files called `makefile.*`.  The one we want is the one for the OpenWatcom C compiler, `makefile.wcl`, so copy that to `makefile`.

Unfortunately, for "reasons" there are some issues with this makefile, namely that at the link stage it passes far to many arguments to the linker, causing it to fail.  Luckily, I discovered a shorter way of linking the binary earlier when I was trying bwBASIC's `compile.bat` to build the binary (which also works as long as you edit both it and `stdcomp.bat` appropriately.)

So we need to replace that line, line 55 (here I've commented it out with a `#`) so that instead of `	$(LINK) $(LFLAGS) FILE $(OFILES: =,) NAME $@` it reads `	$(CC) *.obj -we=$(PROj).exe`.  Note that the space at the start of the line is a TAB:

```make
$(PROJ).exe:	$(OFILES)
#	$(LINK) $(LFLAGS) FILE $(OFILES: =,) NAME $@
	$(CC) *.obj -we=$(PROJ).exe
```

You can then issue `wmake` to run the OpenWatcom version of make, and it will build `bwbasic.exe` in your current working directory.

You can run it and bravo, it works!

bwBASIC: 
``` 

(You can exit with `quit`).

At this point you can simply put `bwbasic.exe` somewhere in your `%PATH%` and all will be well.

If you want to package it up, you need to fix some issues with the `dist` target, namely that `$(ZFILES)` contains two patch files which don't exist (line 51), and that the `dist` target tries to create a `.zip` file with a long filename.  These should be trivial to resolve, at which point you can run `wmake dist` to create a zip file with some documentation as well as `bwbasic.exe`.
