title: PI example in your browser
---

Some of you may be aware that my colleague Dr Kirker and I maintain a repository of implementations 
of a particular way of calculating PI in whichever language we are playing with at that moment in 
time [here](https://github.com/UCL-RITS/pi_examples).

These include a wide variety of languages, for example I've been learning [Forth](https://github.com/UCL-RITS/pi_examples/blob/master/forth_pi_dir/pi.fs):

Most recently, I've done a quick [implementation in JavaScript](/pijs/pi.html) which you can play about with in your browser's JavaScript console.
