title: QLM multiplication experiments.
---

A couple of weeks ago I got forwarded a chain of emails from a researcher who was having difficulty getting QLM to do what he expected when he multiplied a `Qint` by an integer.

MyQLM claims to be able to do this both as part of `qftarith` package with [qftarith.mult\_const](https://myqlm.github.io/qat-lang-arith.html#qat.lang.AQASM.qftarith.mult_const), and by operator overloading. As we will see from these examples, this is not the case.
