So it's been a long time since I touched this blog and a lot of stuff has happened.

 * I failed in my initial attempt to become the Head of Research Computing and then succeeded in doing so on the second attempt.
 * We deployed a replacement for our Grace service, a massive update to Myriad, upgrades to our Tier 2s.
 * In March as everyone will be aware the world ended.

It's been a crazy time all around and honestly 2020 is way too much at this point.
